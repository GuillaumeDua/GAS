----------
-> Please notice that this is an old uncomplete project I created when I was a student,
just for the fun =)
I also didnt know what a webservice is when i created it !

Simple test of game engine
-> Use basic C++
-> Use SFML for sprites rendering
-> Use boost for multi-threading and shared ptrs
